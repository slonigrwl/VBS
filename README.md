# VBS


I have committed the vbs lifeway artifacts in this repo. The artifacts would work well with any AEM 6.0 installation.
lifeway-vbs-content-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip is the AEM module containing all the AEM related components , templates and designs
lifeway-vbs-bundle-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is the OSGi bundle for the project.

lifewaycom.zip was a POC for the lifeway.com site when it was thought to move the articles hosted on that site to AEM.
